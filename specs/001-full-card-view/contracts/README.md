# Contracts: Expandable Card Descriptions

No API contracts needed. This feature is entirely frontend — no new backend endpoints, WebSocket messages, or data types are required.

VP condition and resource storage description fields in the backend DTOs are handled in a separate task outside this feature's scope.
