## Game Overview

### Objective
Transform Mars into a habitable planet by raising temperature, oxygen levels, and creating ocean tiles. Players earn Terraform Rating (TR) points for contributing to these global parameters and additional points from cards, awards, and milestones.

### Key Concepts
- **Terraform Rating (TR)**: Starts at 20, increases when contributing to global parameters
- **Global Parameters**: Temperature (-30°C to +8°C), Oxygen (0% to 14%), Ocean tiles (0 to 9)
- **Game End**: Triggered when all three global parameters reach their maximum values
- **Victory**: Player with highest TR + VP from cards wins

## Components

### Game Board
- Mars game board with hex spaces for tiles
- Temperature track (-30°C to +8°C)
- Oxygen track (0% to 14%)  
- Ocean placement areas (9 total)
- Generation marker track

### Cards
- **Project Cards**: 208 cards with various effects and costs
- **Corporation Cards**: Asymmetric player powers and starting resources
- **Prelude Cards**: Optional expansion for faster game start

### Resources
- **MegaCredits (MC)**: Primary currency
- **Steel**: Reduces building costs
- **Titanium**: Reduces space project costs
- **Plants**: Can be converted to greenery tiles
- **Energy**: Converts to heat each generation
- **Heat**: Can be spent to raise temperature

### Production
Each resource has a corresponding production track that generates resources each generation.

## Setup

### Initial Setup
1. **Place game board** in center of table
2. **Shuffle project cards** and deal starting hands
3. **Give each player**:
   - Player board and markers
   - Starting resources (varies by player count)

4. **Corporation selection** (if using)
5. **Initial card drafting and purchasing**
6. **Place starting tiles** (if any from corporations)

### Player Count Variations
- **2 Players**: Special neutral city placement rules
- **3-5 Players**: Standard rules
- **Solo Variant**: Available with specific rule modifications

## Gameplay Flow

### Generation Structure
Each generation consists of four phases:
1. **Research Phase**: Draw and purchase new project cards
2. **Action Phase**: Players take turns performing actions
3. **Production Phase**: Collect resources based on production levels
4. **Solar Phase**: Move generation marker, check game end

### Action Phase Details
Players take turns performing **1-2 actions** per turn until all players pass consecutively.

## Corporation Phase

### Corporation Selection
- Each player receives 2 corporation cards (draft or random)
- Choose 1 corporation to play
- Receive starting resources and production as specified
- Some corporations have immediate effects or ongoing abilities

### Corporation Types
- **Resource-focused**: Provide bonus resources or production
- **Action-based**: Offer unique repeatable actions
- **Conditional**: Provide benefits based on game state
- **Terraforming**: Bonus points for specific global parameter contributions

## Action Phase

### Available Actions
1. **Play a Project Card**: Pay cost, gain immediate and ongoing effects
2. **Use a Standard Project**: Always available basic actions
3. **Claim a Milestone**: First to achieve specific conditions (3 max per game)
4. **Fund an Award**: Pay to create end-game scoring opportunity (3 max per game)
5. **Use Action on Card**: Activate blue action cards
6. **Convert Plants**: 8 plants → 1 greenery tile → +1 oxygen → +1 TR
7. **Convert Heat**: 8 heat → +1 temperature → +1 TR

### Standard Projects
- **Sell Patents**: Discard cards for 1 MC each
- **Power Plant**: Spend 11 MC for +1 energy production
- **Asteroid**: Spend 14 MC for +1 temperature
- **Aquifer**: Spend 18 MC for 1 ocean tile
- **Greenery**: Spend 23 MC for 1 greenery tile
- **City**: Spend 25 MC for 1 city tile

### Card Play Rules
- **Requirements**: Must meet all requirements to play (temperature, oxygen, etc.)
- **Immediate Effects**: Happen when card is played
- **Ongoing Effects**: Permanent benefits
- **Action Effects**: Blue cards with repeatable actions

## Production Phase

### Production Sequence
1. **Energy to Heat**: All energy converts to heat
2. **Resource Production**: Gain resources equal to production levels
3. **World Government Terraforming**: AI performs standard terraforming actions (if enabled)

### Resource Limits
- **MegaCredits**: No limit
- **Other Resources**: No official limit, but practical table space applies
- **Cards in Hand**: No limit

## Card Types and Mechanics

### Card Colors and Types
- **Green Cards**: Immediate effects, go to play area
- **Blue Cards**: Ongoing effects with repeatable actions
- **Red Cards**: Immediate effects, discarded after use

### Card Categories
- **Building**: Often reduced by steel
- **Space**: Often reduced by titanium  
- **Power**: Energy-related effects
- **Science**: Research and technology
- **Microbe**: Biological effects
- **Animal**: Creature-based effects
- **Plant**: Vegetation effects
- **City**: Urban development
- **Earth**: Earth-based projects

### Tags and Synergies
Cards have tags that interact with other cards and provide synergistic effects.

## Global Parameters

### Temperature Track
- **Range**: -30°C to +8°C (20 steps)
- **TR Bonus**: +1 TR per step increased
- **Cost**: 8 heat per step via convert heat action
- **Bonuses**: Heat production increases at -24°C and -20°C

### Oxygen Track  
- **Range**: 0% to 14% (14 steps)
- **TR Bonus**: +1 TR per step increased
- **Method**: Place greenery tiles (1 tile = +1 oxygen)
- **Bonuses**: Temperature increases at 8% oxygen

### Ocean Tiles
- **Total**: 9 ocean tiles maximum
- **TR Bonus**: +1 TR per ocean placed
- **Placement**: Specific ocean areas only
- **Bonuses**: Temperature increases when 3rd, 6th, and 9th oceans placed

## Resources and Production

### Resource Management
- **Production Tracks**: Generate resources each generation
- **Cube Management**: Physical resource cubes track current amounts
- **Negative Production**: Can go below zero, reducing generation income

### Resource Conversion
- **Steel Discount**: Each steel reduces building costs by 2 MC
- **Titanium Discount**: Each titanium reduces space project costs by 3 MC
- **Plant Conversion**: 8 plants → 1 greenery → +1 oxygen → +1 TR

## Victory Conditions

### Game End Trigger
Game ends immediately when all three global parameters reach maximum:
- Temperature: +8°C
- Oxygen: 14%  
- Oceans: 9 tiles placed

### Scoring
**Final Score = TR + VP from cards + Milestones + Awards**

#### Terraform Rating (TR)
- Base 20 + increases from global parameter contributions
- Each temperature step: +1 TR
- Each oxygen step: +1 TR  
- Each ocean tile: +1 TR

#### Victory Points from Cards
- Green cards often provide VP
- Some cards provide conditional VP based on game state
- Tags and synergies can provide bonus VP

#### Milestones (3 available per game)
- **Terraformer**: 35+ TR (5 VP)
- **Mayor**: 3+ cities (5 VP)  
- **Gardener**: 3+ greenery tiles (5 VP)
- **Builder**: 8+ building tags (5 VP)
- **Planner**: 16+ cards in hand (5 VP)

#### Awards (3 funded per game)
End-game scoring based on specific criteria:
- **Landlord**: Most tiles in play
- **Banker**: Most MC production
- **Scientist**: Most science tags
- **Thermalist**: Most heat resource
- **Miner**: Most steel/titanium resources

### Tiebreakers
1. Most MegaCredits
2. Most cards played

## Special Rules and Clarifications

### Tile Placement Rules
- **Adjacency Bonuses**: Placing tiles adjacent to others provides benefits
- **Ocean Adjacency**: +2 MC per adjacent ocean
- **Greenery Placement**: Must be placed adjacent to your tiles if possible
- **City Placement**: Cannot be adjacent to other cities

### Card Interactions

- **Duplicate Effects**: Multiple copies of same effect stack
- **Tag Counting**: Count tags on corporations and played cards

### Advanced Rules
- **Drafting Variant**: Pass hands during research phase for more strategic card selection
- **Corporate Era**: Use corporation cards for asymmetric player powers
- **Solo Variant**: Special rules for single-player experience
- **Prelude Expansion**: Optional cards for faster game start

### Common Clarifications
- **Global Parameter Maximum**: Actions that would exceed maximum values are wasted
- **Forced Actions**: Some effects force actions even if not beneficial
- **Payment Timing**: Pay all costs before gaining any benefits
- **Card Timing**: Immediate effects resolve before choosing where to place tiles
