Water Import From Europa: Needs titanium mapping
Research Output: Missing city icon on card with asterix
Phobos Space Heaven: Missing city icon on card with asterix, might need extra modelling due to the moon placement
Predators: Should be <animal tag any> -> <animal tag>, now its wrong
Optimal Aerobreaking: Layout broken
Security Fleet: Wrong icon on card, should be fighter (it is now titanium in action box and asteroid in VP box)
Ants: Should be <microbe tag any> -> <microbe tag>, now its wrong
Natural Reserve: We can't place that tile at all. It is a "nature tile", should be like Research output (next to no other tile)
Virus: Should be a minus sign on 2 <animal icon> and 5 <plant icon>. It looks now like it is given to other players in stead of removing resources
Mining Expedition: Should be a minus sign infront of plants icon
Mining Area: We can't place that tile at all. Will need a mining tile and a mining model for Mars
Mining Rights: We can't place that tile at all. Will need a mining tile and a mining model for Mars
Land Claim: We need a 3D model for this so it is easy to say it is reseved, could be completley virtual with a lock or something
Mars University: Completely missing the logic, needs full check
Mars Converter: Missing "Increase energy production 6 stpes"
Physics Complex: Should be 2 VP per science resource, NOT per 2 science resource
Greenhouses: City tile on the card should have "any city" mark (red outline)
Nuclear Zone: We can't place that tile at all. Need tile for nuclear zone and a model + nuke animation, maybe a bomb flying in?
Toll station: Titanium tag icon in the behavior on the card should have "any titanium tag" (so red tint behind it)
Media Group: Should have "After you play an event card" effect
